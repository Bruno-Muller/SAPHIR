SAPHIR : Spatial Adapted Program-Human Interface Rendering

for 0x10c


I decided to learn and make my own little OS.
This may not have a great value compared to other OS (FrOST, Atlas and so on...)
But contributions, advices and so on are welcome.

Just know that I'll add content as I learn. Don't speak me of multi-tasking or interruption handling... For now :)

Current objectives are to finish the loading/unloading routine and performing a more advanced memory management, filling the blank space while unloading a file to optimize memory space.

As far as I've tested it, loading and executing a prog work. I'll upload in the few days complete specifications for the OS if you wanna give it a try.
